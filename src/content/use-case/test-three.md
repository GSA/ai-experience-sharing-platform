We are eager to partner with more organizations, envision scaling this tool to be a federal government-wide shared service for identifying overlapping and duplicative research grants.

## Data and Data Management

The data used for this service include the research proposals that are submitted to National Science Foundation and National Institute of Health. The training set used in this Machine Learning algorithm includes a list of condensed scientific terminologies from the above data.

## Technical Solution, Tools and Technology

A data science, machine learning tool to create proposal fingerprints. These proposal fingerprints are encoded such that privacy and intellectual properties are protected. The encoded proposal data are shared between NSF and NIH. Data science models such as Word2Vec are applied to the encoded data to reveal overlaps. The identified overlaps are databased using Distributed Ledger Technology. Program offices are alerted when overlaps are identified.
