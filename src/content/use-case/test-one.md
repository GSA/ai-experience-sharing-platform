The new AI-based “Suggest Reviewer” tool replaced a legacy process where NSF program staff across the agency were involved in manually identifying reviewers. It significantly reduced the administrative burden on NSF staff, provided support for evidence-based decision making, introduced the culture for NSF staff to learn to work alongside AI and promoted the practice of continuous innovation.

## Data and Data Management

The data used for this service include the research proposals that are submitted to National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation researcher profile databases and third-party data such as research publications. The training set used in this Machine Learning algorithm includes a list of condensed scientific terminologies from the above data sets.

## Technical Solution, Tools and Technology

"Suggest Reviewers” – The tool automatically analyses submitted proposals (~ each 15 pages), clusters documents (proposals, publications) with a similar distribution of co-occurring themes with relevant research expertise (profiles), then upon request provides Program Office with a list of people, with prescreened conflicts, who might be able to serve as reviewers in the Merit Review Panel. It uses AI techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
