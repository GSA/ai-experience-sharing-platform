Use of NLP (text mining and topic modeling) to model relationships between drugs and a single medical condition, hepatic (i.e., liver) failure. \n2.  Use of text-based rules, decision trees using text clustering inputs, and a simple neural network to predict serious drug related adverse outcomes. \n3.  Use of structured features and expert derived terms from unstructured text to predict these ground truth labels. Then trained various supervised models (RF & SVM).\n\n## [](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)[](#lessons-learned)Lessons Learned\n\nData limitations (including the nature of the data and reporting on a negative outcome) can make it difficult to uncover a causal relationship.\n\nNLP algorithms are continually improving. However, as NLP technology currently stands, without some expert input, it may not be well-suited to critical tasks in which inaccurate predictions could have severe life-or-death consequences. NLP’s shortcomings are almost certain to be magnified in an environment where the text is both unstructured and highly technical and where precision and expertise are at an absolute premium. Ultimately, the models did not generate outputs accurate enough for deployment.\n\n## [](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)Contact Information\n\nACUS: Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies\n\n[krista.kinnard@gsa.gov](mailto:krista.kinnard@gsa.gov)\n","name":"emerging-safety-data-processing","path":"/usecase/emerging-safety-data-processing","excerpt":"FDA is piloting of AI/ML techniques to identify emerging safety concerns in reports made to its Federal Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
