We are exploring a number of technical approaches, including rule-based classification systems and simple, explainable machine learning models like Logistic Regression for labeling more complicated items. All work thus far has been done on laptops in Python, using the scikit-learn package.\n\n## [](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)Contact Information\n\nBrandon Kopp\n\n[kopp.brandon@bls.gov](mailto:kopp.brandon@bls.gov)\n","name":"survey-data-collection","path":"/usecase/survey-data-collection","excerpt":"The data that will be used is Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) documents in PDF format along with tabular data of the contents of those documents collected through the National Compensation Survey.
