  "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer science techniques that attempt to simulate human cognitive capabilities. AI will bring about transformative change to most, if not every aspect of humanity, which presents a range of challenges and opportunities. It has already revolutionized the business world and its application across the U.S. Federal government is fundamentally changing the way agencies meet their mission. Government must take these challenges and opportunities head on to stay on the leading edge, sustain a competitive advantage on the global stage, and ensure the long term prosperity of the United States. This guide intends to help government decision makers develop clarity about what AI means for them and their agencies.\n\nBecause AI is such a broad term with new applications emerging across industry and government, the guide begins with baseline definitions of key terms like artificial intelligence, analytics, machine learning, and data science. Then it describes the fundamentals of what AI is and what it isnâ€™t by dispelling some commonly held myths of AI. The guide then explores how government agencies can envision the journey to AI and how to think about the likely impact of AI and automation on the future of work. It does this through describing the complexities inherent in building AI capabilities and in applying them. The guide provides a foundational perspective on the building blocks of successful AI adoption:people and organization,processes, and data and technology. It then applies these concepts to application in AI use case and projects specifically focusing on responsible AI adoption and development.\n",
