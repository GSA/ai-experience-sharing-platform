There may be an analytics or statistics group in some cases, but there will also be individual job functions that may include these skills in any number of areas. To understand the potential individuals, teams and groups to drive AI in an organization, consider these actions:\n\n-   Assess talent: To the extent possible, survey your organization to map existing analytics talent or teams with an analytics orientation. If there is existing talent, where does it report?  IT, a business function, a Chief Experience Officer (CXO)?\n-   Transform existing teams: If there is an existing analytics team, expand the team’s mandate and begin adding more robust data science capabilities and talent. \n-   Create a team from scratch: Keep the existing analytics talent or team as is and hire a new data science manager and data scientists for the new team. Leverage the existing analytics talent as SME’s or domain experts when needed.\n-   Bridge the skill gaps with training: While it may be tempting to try to hire new talent to address emerging AI opportunities, historically it has been challenging for government agencies to attract and retain data science talent due to the field’s highly competitive nature. The best performing analytics-driven organizations usually invest more in developing and bridging existing workforce capabilities rather than hiring new people.\n-   Focus on building collaborative cross-functional teams: All organizations will need a combination of talent types for an effective data science team. While technical capability is certainly important, it is also important to engage across the organization to include business and acquisition professionals to drive AI education and adoption. The team should include:\n\n    -   Authority or influence with sponsoring leadership and the ability to navigate change management processes.\n    -   Robust technical capabilities that include data and information architecture, analytics, machine learning, software engineering, design, user experience (UX), DevOps, and cybersecurity.\n    -   Domain expertise and financial analysis to articulate, translate, and evaluate business, operational, and strategic objectives for the agency.\n    -   Acquisitions specialists who will assist the team with strategy questions and optimizing between internal and external talent and resources.\n    -   Communications and change management experts to drive training, awareness, and broader organizational acceptance of emerging AI tools.\n    -   Hiring specialists who understand the skill sets required of the team to effectively hire new talent. \n\nHaving these diverse skill sets and stakeholders engaged will help align the organization on the problem(s) to solve, and de-risk the solution(s) that will be built.\n","name":"test-resource-2","path":"/resource/test-resource-2","toc":[{"text":"Start with people","url":"#start-with-people"}],"excerpt":"Even the most advanced and technically sound AI solutions will fail to reach their full potential without a dedicated team of people understanding how to apply the capability.
