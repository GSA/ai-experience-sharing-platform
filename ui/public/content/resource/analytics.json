Grouping, summing, or averaging columns or rows in a spreadsheet are basic examples of analytics. A fundamental understanding of analytics is the backbone of building an AI solution.\n\nWe present three broad categories of analytics in this guide. To offer examples of each, consider a dataset of home prices associated with various features of a given home (number of rooms, square feet, year built, etc.)\n\n1.  Descriptive analytics help data teams understand their data and associated characteristics. There is a substantial amount of knowledge to be gained through descriptive analysis. \n\nExample: Describing the median price per home, per neighborhood/zip code\n\n2.  Predictive analytics begins to look at data with a lens toward the future. Based on what we have seen in the past, what can we understand about the future?\n\nExample: Predicting the home prices based on the features of a home, or the zip code that will have the largest increase of home values in the coming year.\n\n3.  Prescriptive analytics takes the process a step further to suggest actions or decisions based on parameters that humans set for the model. Once we understand our data and have started to use it to predict outcomes, can we also evaluate different scenarios and program the model to recommend actions that will bring about the desired outcomes?\n\nExample: Prescribing/recommending the additions to a home that would be the most likely to increase the homeâ€™s price.\n","name":"analytics","path":"/resource/analytics","excerpt":"The term analytics covers the foundational, mathematical manipulations performed on raw data in order to format it in such a way that it becomes more informative than the data on its own.
