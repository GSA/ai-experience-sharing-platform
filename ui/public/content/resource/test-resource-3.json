Adjusting based on model metrics, performance, and impact is required. \n-   Oversight, testing and evaluation are critical: Unlike many traditional software projects, AI models require rigorous evaluation and training to prevent model degradation and ensure the model continues to produce the intended outcome. This requires special attention to the underlying data used to train the model and feedback management from model output throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. \n-   The maintenance phase is never over: Even if a model has been rigorously tested and evaluated, this does not mean it can operate independently, only requiring maintenance when something breaks. AI solutions must continuously collect feedback to ensure that they continue to perform in production to the determined performance standards. \n\nIt is easy to be lured into thinking that if an AI project encounters failure at some point, it is not worth the investment, but this is a pitfall that prevents AI from succeeding in the long term. As an agency leader, it is critical to recognize the level of investment required for testing and evaluation and model maintenance to ensure long term AI success. \n\nThere are many suggested AI methodologies, frameworks and business models. We are focusing on what the AI lifecycle is and how organizations can build a structure to support an AI ecosystem.\n","name":"test-resource-3","path":"/resource/test-resource-3","toc":[{"text":"AI projects are different from traditional software projects","url":"#ai-projects-are-different-from-traditional-software-projects"}],"excerpt":"Understanding the AI development process and the steps required for an organization to embed AI into an operating enterprise system are essential for the successful adoption of AI in an organization.
