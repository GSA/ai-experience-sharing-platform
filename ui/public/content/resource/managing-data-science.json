Roles that support data science teams should include:\n\n-   Project sponsor: Helps identify and approve opportunities and make go/no go decisions. \n-   Business user: Helps identify opportunities and provides business and workflow understanding.\n-   Project manager: Ensures day-to-day progress and communicates with stakeholders and vendors.\n-   Business analyst: Provides business, financial, and data understanding.\n-   Data engineer: Supports data needs and provides data expertise.\n\nThe roles above may need to liaise between data science, IT, and business needs of mission areas. The number of most of these roles may vary depending on the size of the initiative.\n","name":"managing-data-science","path":"/resource/managing-data-science","excerpt":"Different processes and results may emerge depending on who manages analytics and data science within an agency or working area.
