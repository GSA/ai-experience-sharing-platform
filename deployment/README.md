# Deployment infrastructure

This package includes the IOC for a cloud.gov deployment of the Strapi backend, including the self-hosted frontend UI.

## Usage

This configuration is intended to be run via CI, and consists of two components:

- [./manage.sh](manage.sh) - bootstrap script for all actions
- [./terraform](terraform) - Terraform configuration

### Bootstrap cloud.gov

First, you must initialize a new cloud.gov space. This includes creating a space in the target cloud.gov organization, an S3 bucket for Terraform state storage, user provided service for 
login.gov, user provided service for strapi specific environment secrets, a service user and corresponding key for CI jobs. Use the setup operation for this purpose:

```bash
./deployment/manage.sh setup -o <organization name> -s <space name>
```

### Create Terraform workspace

Create a new Terraform workspace in the [./deployment/workspace](./deployment/workspace) directory, using one of the existing workspaces as a template.

Necessary environment configuration may be found with this helper:

```bash
./deployment/manage.sh show -o <organization name> -s <space name>
```


### Deploy

Subsequently, you may use Terraform to deploy into the created cloud.gov space, using the credentials created by the setup job. First, export the necessary credentials into the current environment:

```bash
# So we can create cloud.gov resources, export CF_USER and CF_PASSWORD for the service user, as well as AWS credentials to the Terraform S3 bucket:
source ./deployment/manage.sh export \
    -o <organization name> \
    -s <space name>
```

... and then deploy with Terraform:

```bash
terraform init deployment/workspaces/<space name>
terraform apply deployment/workspaces/<space name>
```

Subsequently, there is a helper that will handle the export and apply in one step:

```bash
./deployment/manage.sh deploy -o <organization name> -s <space name>
```

### Login.gov Configuration

After bootstraping cloud.gov `manage.sh` will create public and private rsa keys in `./deployment` in the format of `deployment/login-gov-${organization_name}-${space_name}-cert.pem`. The public key needs to be added to https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/service_providers/YOUR_NUMBER_HERE . You will also need to configure redirect URIs for your new environment.

## Service Accounts and Secret Rotation

During certain business events secrets and service accounts need to be rotated. Below is an example of how to do this.

```
./manage.sh rotate -o <organization name> -s <space name>
```

## Content Syncing

There is a helper script to move data across lower environments to higher environments. Content can never be any synced from a higher environment to a lower environment, for example do not move content from production to staging. Below is an example to move some content from development to staging. Images will need to be moved manually, image links will change. This script depends on axios being available.

```bash
SOURCEURL="https://strapi-api-host-dev.app.cloud.gov" DESTURL="https://strapi-api-host-staging.app.cloud.gov" DESTTOKEN="TOKEN_HERE" SOURCETOKEN="TOKEN_HERE" node ./cms-content-sync.js
```

After running the script CI/CD updates will be needed. The script will output what needs to be updated.

Output will look like below. Any number that isn't 200 indicates there was a problem. Output: content type, action, http status, slug.

```bash
api-menu updated 200 primary
api-page updated 200 login
api-page updated 200 logout
api-page updated 200 homepage
api-page updated 200 bok
api-page updated 200 about

```
