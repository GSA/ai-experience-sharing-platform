NSF partnered with the CIO Council to offer Udacity Nanodegree Courses, including data analytics and data scientist training for federal staff. Staff must pass a brief aptitude assessment to qualify for the courses. Staff are then assigned to a course and begin an ~ 8 hour a week, 6-month long program of virtual learning. The tool offers participants virtual mentors and helps monitor participants' progress.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nDorothy Aronson\n\ndaronson@nsf.gov"
