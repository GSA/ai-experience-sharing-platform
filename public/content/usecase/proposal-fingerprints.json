The training set used in this Machine Learning algorithm includes a list of condensed scientific terminologies from the above data.\n\n## [](#tools-and-technology)[](#tools-and-technology)Tools and Technology\n\nA data science, machine learning tool to create proposal fingerprints. These proposal fingerprints are encoded such that privacy and intellectual properties are protected. The encoded proposal data are shared between NSF and NIH. Data science models such as Word2Vec are applied to the encoded data to reveal overlaps. The identified overlaps are databased using Distributed Ledger Technology. Program offices are alerted when overlaps are identified.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nDorothy Aronson\n\ndaronson@nsf.gov"
