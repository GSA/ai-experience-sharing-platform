These proposal fingerprints are encoded such that privacy and intellectual properties are protected. The encoded proposal data are shared between NSF and NIH. Data science models such as Word2Vec are applied to the encoded data to reveal overlaps. The identified overlaps are databased using Distributed Ledger Technology. Program offices are alerted when overlaps are identified.\n\n## [](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)[](#contact-information)Contact Information\n\nDorothy Aronson\n\n[daronson@nsf.gov](mailto:daronson@nsf.gov)\n","name":"proposal-fingerprints","path":"/usecase/proposal-fingerprints","excerpt":"The data used for this service include the research proposals that are submitted to National Science Foundation and National Institute of Health.
