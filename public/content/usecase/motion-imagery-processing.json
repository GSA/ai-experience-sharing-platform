The U.S. Passport and Visa database also serves as a source of data for large numbers of images of faces.\n\n## [](#tools-and-technology)Tools and Technology\n\nFacial Recognition systems match a given image or video of a face with an identity. They first detect the face in a cluttered or crowded setting, then match its features against that of known faces in the CBP database. The models are from private vendors in which the models and model training process are held as trade secrets.\n\n## [](#contact-information)Contact Information\n\nACUS: Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies\n\n[krista.kinnard@gsa.gov](mailto:krista.kinnard@gsa.gov)\n","name":"motion-imagery-processing","path":"/usecase/motion-imagery-processing","excerpt":"CBP is in constant pursuit of innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of existing procedures to monitor and process both people and cargo that enter the country.
