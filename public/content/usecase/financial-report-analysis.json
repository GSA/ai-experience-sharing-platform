  "body": "There are over 7,000 corporate issuers of securities who must submit financial statements (i.e. annual 10-K, quarterly 10-Q forms) for oversight. Each report can be hundreds of pages long and include general information about the business, risk factors, financial data and MD&As. Analyzing these reports is a very time intensive process. CIRA’s goal is to help more efficiently utilize SECs limited resources by identifying corporate filters that warrant additional investigation.\n\n## Data Approach\n\nThe tool is trained on historical datasets of past issuer filings.\n\n## Tools and Technology\n\nThis is a machine learning model (Random forest) that identifies which filers might be engaged in suspect earnings management. It uses indicators such as earnings restatements and past enforcement actions.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nA human eye is critical for considering accuracy and performance metrics.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nACUS: Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies\n\nkrista.kinnard@gsa.gov"
