  "body": "Risk prediction modeling uses statistical methods to assess particularized future risks, such as the probability that an individual will develop a specific illness. To assess the potential security risks posed by each of the hundreds of millions of people, vehicles, and containers crossing U.S. borders, CBP employs a bundle of programs termed Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies the Automated Targeting System.\n\n## Data Approach\n\nData collected from across DHS including Advanced Passenger Information System, Nonimmigrant Information System, Enforcement Integrated Database, the FBI Terrorist Screening Database and the DOJ National Crime Information Center. The program also leverages commercial data including billing and email address, payment information, in-flight seat locations, meal preferences and baggage data directly from airline carriers.\n\n## Tools and Technology\n\nAutomated Targeting System-- a bundle of private machine learning solutions that leverage both government and non-government data to predict if an individual poses a particular risk upon entry to the country.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nEthics and oversight are important yet challenging.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBusiness Function - Risk Prediction Modeling\n\nProduction Status - In Pilot\n\nAgency - Department of Homeland Security, United States Customs and Border Protection\n\nPOC Name - ACUS: Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies\n\nPOC Email - krista.kinnard@gsa.gov"
