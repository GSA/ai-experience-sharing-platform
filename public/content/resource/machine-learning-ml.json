Increased computing capacity (especially for the elastic computing infrastructure in the cloud), large-scale labelled data sets, and widely distributed open-source machine learning frameworks and codes propelled the development of machine learning models which currently power most AI solutions. Though the study of machine learning can quickly become an overwhelming endeavour, this guide will give government leaders a basic understanding of these solutions and how they may be applied for the benefit of Federal agencies.\n\nThere are three high level categories of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Each has its own mathematical backbone and each has its own unique areas of application.  In more complex workflows, they may sometimes be applied together in combination. \n\n**Supervised learning** is the most widely adopted machine learning method given its clear learning goal and close resemblance to human behavior. Supervised learning learns a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. The example output is often referred to as “label”, which can be either created by manual labeling or from outcomes of historical data, such as a picture of a cat with an associated “cat” label and home sales price for each transaction in the US. \n\nSupervised learning is widely used in object recognition in self-driving cars, fraud detection, and clinical decision support. Mostly recently, it leads to much improved experience in the state-of-the-art chatbots, as the chatbots learn about paraphrasing in human language.\n\n**Unsupervised learning** is often used in data exploration before a learning goal is established. Unlike the training and testing steps in supervised learning, unsupervised learning tends to emphasize the goodness-of-fit of the data. Analysts often independently experiment with multiple unsupervised learning methods or the same method but with different parameters, and then they review the goodness-of-fit through a mathematical cost function or visualization technique. \n\nUnsupervised learning is widely used in fraud detection to segment different behavior patterns. \n\nReinforcement learning makes discrete sequential decisions of the overall learning space. Similar to unsupervised learning, labels are not needed in reinforcement learning. A reinforcement learning agent receives incremental reward or penalty each time it makes a decision. The next decision is based on all the accumulated knowledge developed through the prior experience, and the goal is to maximize the accumulated rewards.\n\n**Reinforcement learning** is commonly used in navigation use cases and games like chess or Go. For example, a robot decides whether it should enter a new room in search of more trash to collect or start to find its way back to the battery charging dock. The robot makes the decision based on the current battery charge level and how quickly it has been able to find the charging dock in the past.\n","fields":[{"key":"category","title":"CAtegory","value":"terminology"},{"key":"tags","title":"Tags","value":"AI terminology"}],"name":"machine-learning-ml","path":"/resource/machine-learning-ml","excerpt":"Machine learning differs from analytics by the nature of its iterative approach to problem solving.
