  "body": "Emerging AI applications offer many compelling opportunities to government leaders. But to take advantage of those opportunities, agencies need workforces that possess data literacy and the ability to integrate new digital solutions into their workflows. Organizations often default to quick-fix solutions to technology problems, but because of the complexity of AI, such approaches will not lead to an AI-driven organization with robust data and analytics capabilities. Furthermore, organizations that rely too heavily on acquiring external AI talent and solutions tend to perform more poorly than those that invest in internal development.\n\nTo achieve AI success, the federal government and individual agencies need foundational in-house AI capability-building programs. Cross-agency learning pathways and partnerships will also develop with consideration for each agency’s own workforce transformation roadmaps. \n\nSome agencies have already begun to create data science training programs within their organization. Many have similar key components:\n\n* Understand data: Agencies manage and access large amounts of data. Understanding how those data are managed, and how to interact with them in a way to produce meaningful insight is a key step to data literacy.\n* Collaboration: Shared learning experience enables an agency’s workforce to create a community of skilled data scientists who continuously learn from experts and from each other.\n* Learning cohorts: Learning cohorts bring in experts from the data science field to lead short-term educational programs. Participants gain hands-on data science skills to address real agency problems.\n\nThis type of internal learning framework can help make the lessons of data science curriculum directly applicable to agency mission delivery. While many external learning programs offer AI-related content, the question of whether to use these resources should be weighed against the fact that they are not designed to address agency-specific challenges to bring about the deep and lasting cultural changes that federal agencies ultimately need.\n\n## Innovating with learning programs\n\nWhen evaluating ways to stand up learning programs that produce data literacy, bridge skill gaps, and drive agency-wide transformation, consider these key steps: \n\n* Secure ongoing senior sponsorship to establish a common vision, language, and learning curriculum.\n* Create a program leadership team and cultivate internal faculty.\n* Produce learning content that is foundational for everyone, but also content tailored to agency goals and AI objectives.\n* Create pathways for active apprenticeships between established and aspiring AI practitioners.\n* Develop mechanisms to fill the talent vacuum left when students of analytics and AI move into their new roles in the agency.\n* Keep content relevant, up-to-date, and responsive to evolving agency needs.\n* Include all roles in the workforce to make sure no one is left behind.\n* Tie the learning modules to broader transformational goals of the agency.\n* Certification programs that produce qualified data science team members can lead into certifications for entire teams to take on AI projects.\n* Go beyond technical skills to cultivate change, drive cross-boundary collaboration, and bring about an agency-wide vision of digital transformation.\n\n## The challenge of bringing AI into agency workflows\n\nOperationalizing AI at scale requires data modernization and organizational data science capabilities. One of the most significant challenges in integrating AI solutions into human workflows. Resolving last mile challenges and the problems of human plus machine collaboration requires coordinated resources for workforce development and change management."
