  "body": "A properly designed project charter can mitigate many risks and help ensure the successful implementation of an AI project. The main elements of a charter should include the following:\n\n* Problem/mission statement: What is the problem that needs to be solved? What impact would a successful solution have?\n* Clear deliverables and success criteria: How exactly will success be measured? \n* Well-defined scope: What is within the scope of the project and what is outside the scope?\n* Techstack: What tools and technologies will be used in the project?\n* Data assets: What data will be accessible and what are the access, storage, and sharing protocols? Are there relevant data inventories and data dictionaries? \n* Realistic timeline: What does the work plan with chronological elements and milestones look like?\n* Stakeholders: Who are the key stakeholders and what are their roles?\n* Constraints: What kind of constraints exist in regard to budget, data, deadlines, compliance, etc. and how will they impact the project?\n* Potential risks and mitigants: What risks does the project face or pose and how are the risks being addressed?\n* Dependencies: What other factors and dynamics may impact the deliverables or constraints of the project?"
