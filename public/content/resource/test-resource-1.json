It is important to keep in mind that the definition of AI is still evolving. Some common definitions of artificial intelligence include:\n\n-   A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.\n-   Advanced statistical and analytical methods such as machine learning and artificial neural networks, especially deep learning.\n-   A computer system able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n\nFor the purpose of this guide, AI will refer to a range of solutions and applications that employ advanced analytics and machine learning. In practice, AI is the use of math and software techniques to provide insight and capacity to inform, expedite, or enhance human decision making.\n","name":"test-resource-1","path":"/resource/test-resource-1","toc":[],"excerpt":"AI combines many disciplines with an intention of simulating human behavior through the use of technology.
