Whether an agency is focused more on buying AI solutions or developing in-house talent, at least some level of internal data science capabilities will always be necessary and there will almost always be some analytics talent already present.\n\nExactly how much talent may already exist and how it may be currently distributed in a given federal agency will vary, but there are some proven organizational models for analytics and AI that may be worth working toward.  We will briefly examine a centralized model, a decentralized model, and a hybrid model, and their respective characteristics.\n\n### [](#centralized-model)[](#centralized-model)[](#centralized-model)[](#centralized-model)[](#centralized-model)[](#centralized-model)Centralized Model\n\n-   Data science sits on top of different mission areas or operating divisions.\n-   Allows for broader view, but potentially with less focus.\n-   Generalist model.\n-   One-size-fits-all approach to mission areas.\n-   Sits higher in the organizational chart.\n-   Conducive to more homogeneity in regard to tools, processes, and perspective.\n-   Allows for more career growth for individual data scientists because of the larger team.\n\n### [](#decentralized-model)[](#decentralized-model)[](#decentralized-model)[](#decentralized-model)[](#decentralized-model)[](#decentralized-model)Decentralized Model\n\n-   Data science is broken up into smaller teams that sit within mission areas or operating divisions.\n-   Allows for more depth and focus for each team.\n-   Specialist model.\n-   AI is tailored to each mission area.\n-   Data science sits lower down in the organizational chart.\n-   Results in diverse pockets of tools, processes, and perspectives.\n-   Due to the smaller size of data science teams, may provide limited career growth.\n\n### [](#hybrid-model)[](#hybrid-model)[](#hybrid-model)[](#hybrid-model)[](#hybrid-model)[](#hybrid-model)Hybrid Model\n\n-   Combination of centralized and decentralized elements.\n-   May reflect the starting reality for many agencies and organizations.\n-   May be conducive to an AI Center of Excellence framing.\n-   Can leverage senior sponsorship for data science, but also achieve depth in mission areas.\n-   Will have diverse pockets of tools, but can also make use of centralized capabilities.\n-   May allow for a range of career growth opportunities.\n-   May experience tension between centralized teams and specialist teams.\n\n## [](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)[](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)[](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)[](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)[](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)[](#when-to-supplement-internal-talent)When to supplement internal talent\n\nAs agencies think through the possible objectives during their AI journey, the question of whether and when to bring in outside talent will frequently come up.  \n\nWhen to bring in outside talent or vendors\n\n-   The agency’s AI problems are standard and won’t require much customization. In such cases prepackaged software solutions (discussed in greater detail in the Technology and Data  section) may be more worthwhile to evaluate.\n-   The agency has had difficulty attracting, training, and retaining the kind of data science talent it requires to achieve some of its objectives.  \n-   The use cases in question are limited and require niche skills that may not be worth hiring for and developing over the long term.\n-   The agency needs to quickly test the potential benefits of an AI solution before deciding whether to make an investment in developing internal capabilities. However, the reverse may also be true. An agency may wish to use internal talent to quickly test a new capability being pitched by a vendor before deciding to invest in the outside resources. We discuss this further in the “Internal Prototype/Pilot” under Use Cases and Projects.\n","name":"ai-talent","path":"/resource/ai-talent","excerpt":"When thinking through the kinds of talent and team combinations best suited to standing up AI and data science capabilities, the discussion will quickly turn to where such talent might already sit or should sit within an organization.
